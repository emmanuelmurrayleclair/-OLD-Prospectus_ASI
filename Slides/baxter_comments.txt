First slide: 
 -global climate change is a problem. There is an externality. Then, say "in practice, it is not feasible to measure carbon emissions bcause that would require puting emissions device on every car etc."
 -in practice we tax fuels, not emissions
 -then, make a bridge to say that the details of how we implement these taxes matter in the real world
 -what proportion of total emissions are by firms vs. consumers?

Second slide (fourth slide in current):
 - What I do, THEN tell what others are doinh
 - too wordy, use bullet points: novel empirical evidence, india plants, etc.
 - say optimal tax is not proportional to carobn emissions but is dependent on the substitutability of these fuels because it is costly to switch between fuels
 
Next slide:
 - key mechanism (actual findings of the data) and what the model says
 - 

Last slide of introduction:
 - Contribution, about the literature

data:
- repeated cross section and do my best to match plants over time
- single statistics and reference for these industries
- can actually use different fuels
- more empirical evidence on switching 
- say why i decompose change in ghg emissions
  - simpler decomposition? 
  - find a way to say this more precisely

Model:
 - model overview slide
